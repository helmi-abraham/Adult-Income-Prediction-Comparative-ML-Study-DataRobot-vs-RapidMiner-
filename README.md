# Adult-Income-Prediction-Comparative-ML-Study-DataRobot-vs-RapidMiner-
Conducted a comprehensive comparison of manual and automated machine learning approaches on the Adult Income dataset (Kaggle). Explored model building in DataRobot Autopilot, RapidMiner AutoML, and a custom RapidMiner pipeline with optimized parameters. Applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to evaluate models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and XGBoost. Achieved best performance with Gradient Boosted Trees (~86.7% accuracy in manual RapidMiner) and DataRobotâ€™s XGBoost (~87.1% accuracy). The project highlighted trade-offs between automation speed and manual fine-tuning accuracy, providing insights into real-world applications of AutoML versus custom pipelines.
